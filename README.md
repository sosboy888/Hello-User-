# Hello User!
Uses a PIR sensor on an Arduino to detect if the user has come near the computer to operate it, and if the user is detected by the PIR sensor, a google tab is opened and is ready to go. The functionality to open the web browser can be replaced easily with something else as well, such as booting up a computer using relays, etc.

## The connections on the Arduino are as follows:
1. Pin 7 to the data port of the PIR module.(The middle pin)
2. If the sensor is held such that the three pins are on the top side, the left pin can be connected to GND.
3. The remaining pin is connected to +5V.
